# Project Spade
_Societies built using the React Framework_
https://society-hub-api.herokuapp.com/
## Getting Started
### Creating your first pull request:
- Clone the repo
- Create a branch from Master with pr-test/[name] (i.e. pr-test/dylantheriot)
- Update contributors.txt with your information! You can say anything fun, just keep it PG-13 as we may release this to the public one day... :D
- Create your pull request to master
- Have someone code review it (check that it's PG-13), and complete or redo the PR
- Once the PR is complete, delete the branch!
_Note: This is the ONLY branch you will make directly from Master._

### Installation
_Frontend_
- Install the recommended version of Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone this repo in your desired location and change your directory to it
- Run the command `npm install`

_Backend_

### Branching and AGILE Guidelines
- The Master branch will be used as our **production branch**
- Each sprint, a new branch will be made with the version of that sprint (i.e. v0.1). This should be done by the current PM
- Branches should be made off of the current version's branch
    - The naming convention should be [label]/short-description-[last name] (i.e. minor-update/changed-jumbotron-pictures-theriot)
    - **EVERY** PR for that sprint will be made to the VERSION BRANCH. Set BASE equal to the version number when completing a PR.
    - Therefore the **staging branch** will be the current version's branch. 
- At the end of a sprint, a Co-Chair or the PM will merge the version branch into master.
- The team should then get together to discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and what to put on the backlog for the next sprint.
